# About the project

My first, very simple web project. The application allows the user to add and remove tasks in a clean and straightforward list. The project is minimalistic, responsive, and available online in a live version at [this address](https://piesikot.co/todolist.html).

## Technologies

- HTML5 â€“ page structure.
- CSS3 â€“ simple styling, responsive units (`vw`, `vmax`).
- Vanilla JavaScript â€“ event handling (`addEventListener`), DOM manipulation (`createElement`, `appendChild`, `remove`).
- Responsiveness â€“ thanks to relative units, the page adjusts to various screen resolutions.
